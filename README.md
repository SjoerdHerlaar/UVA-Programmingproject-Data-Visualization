# UVA-Programmingproject - COP21

## Project Outline

During this project a visualization of the COP21 agreements and the Dutch "Energieakkoord" will be created in order to show what progress is still to be made and how quickly this progress should be made for the Netherlands in order to make the goals that were agreed on. The visualization will focus on agreements that can easily be defined and quantified. These definitions will be shown in text, and progress is to be shown by means of piecharts and barcharts. These charts will show how far away we are from reaching the goal, and how mouch progress should be made in order to reach the goal in time and where we might end up if we keep the pace we have had for the past few years.

## Features

The visualization will feature an overview of all the quantifiable agreements made and will show the user of this visualization how much progress has been made, how much there still has to be done and how much should be done per given unit of time in order to reach the given goal. This can make the agreement  easier to grasp and understand. Since the focus will be on quantifiable data, piecharts, barcharts and other visualizations that can show progress will be used. The visualizations are focused around energy consumption and greenhouse gas production, this data will be visualized by deconstructable pie- or barcharts in order to show of what this consumption and production consists. Hopefully this can help in clarifying the agreements and make users less ignorant when it comes to sustainability. Each of the parts that are shown in the charts will show an explaination of how this data has come about and what the government of the user can do to help better it.

## Components

The visualization will consist of a combination of different visualizations that will be show the progress for each agreement that is included within the visualization. The user will be able to toggle between real-life progress and where the given country is supposed to be at this point. Pie- and barcharts will be used for this, and a line chart can be added to show pogress over time, not just the static progress as shown in the pie- and barcharts. If it fits within the timeframe, a visualization for the entire country as wel as a visualization for a household will be made.

## Platform and API's

This visualization will be built using D3, as of now no other platforms or API's will be used but this can change in the future.

## Potential Problems

The first and foremost problem that might arise is the lack of data. The COP21 agreement is fairly new, and not being able to find the right data will instantly kill this idea, forcing to find a different subject. Other problems might be the time constraints and overestimation of my programming skills.

## Review of similar applications

As of now no similar visualizations have been found. The United Nations has created a visualization that shows which country or continent made which promises during the new COP21 agreements, this can be shown at http://www.cop21.gouv.fr/en/learn/country-by-country/
No other breakdowns of the agreements have been found.
